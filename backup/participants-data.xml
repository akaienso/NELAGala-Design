		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="has-nv-dark-bg-color has-text-color">The Sons of Italy Foundation is pleased to welcome The Sicilian Tenors, fresh off their award winning program airing on PBS stations around the country, in their first performance at the annual National Education &amp; Leadership Awards Gala. The Sicilian Tenors will take the audience on a romantic journey to Italy, for some Neapolitan classics, and then back to America for a few Italian-American classics as well, including a new song in honor of the great Luciano Pavarotti.</p>
<p class="has-nv-dark-bg-color has-text-color">Aaron Caruso, Elio Scaccio, and Sam Vitale, proudly represent the best in Italian and Italian-American music as they perform across the United States and all over the world. They have performed at Carnegie Hall, NBC’s Saturday Night Live studio for a worldwide Comcast Special, multiple venues in Las Vegas, and have sung patriotic songs at major sporting events for MLB, NFL, and NHL games, and have been the headliners at the country’s biggest Italian Festivals.</p>
<p class="has-nv-dark-bg-color has-text-color">The Sicilian Tenors are honored to be the sponsors of the new “The Neapolitan and Italian Art Song Competition – Scholarship Award” which will be held annually at The University of Michigan School of Music. They will honor the great music of our heritage and help promote it for future generations of singers to come.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="has-nv-dark-bg-color has-text-color">Augustin “Augie” Tellez is the executive vice president of the Seafarers International Union. He was appointed to that position in November 2005 and subsequently has been reelected multiple times by the union’s membership.</p>
<p class="has-nv-dark-bg-color has-text-color">Previously, he served as the union’s vice president of contracts and contracts enforcement from 1991-2005. In that post, he managed the SIU’s collective bargaining and contract implementation efforts throughout all segments of the industry, including deep sea, Great Lakes, inland and passenger vessels.</p>
<p class="has-nv-dark-bg-color has-text-color">Tellez was appointed as vice president in 1991 by the SIU executive board. He was elected to a full term by the union’s membership in 1992 and was reelected thereafter.</p>
<p class="has-nv-dark-bg-color has-text-color">He also serves as a trustee for the Paul Hall Center for Maritime Training and Education – a world-class, comprehensive vocational education institution located in Piney Point, Md. Additionally, Tellez chairs the Paul Hall Center’s advisory board, composed of high-ranking industry representatives from labor, management and government.</p>
<p class="has-nv-dark-bg-color has-text-color">Serving under the respective administrations of the late SIU President Frank Drozak, retired SIU President Michael Sacco and current SIU President David Heindel, Tellez has helped lead the union to numerous contractual gains and improved benefits for SIU members and their families.</p>
<p class="has-nv-dark-bg-color has-text-color">As a Paul Hall Center trustee and advisory board chairman, he helped spearhead the construction of two unsurpassed additions at the school designed to promote shipboard safety: the Joseph Sacco Fire Fighting and Safety School, which opened in 1999 and specifically is tailored for marine fire fighting training; and a state-of-the-art simulator building that houses top-notch simulators for shiphandling, engine room operations, liquid cargo procedures, crane operations and more. The latter opened in October 2000.</p>
<p class="has-nv-dark-bg-color has-text-color">Tellez also worked closely with the development team that put together the union’s Coast Guard-accepted training record book – a groundbreaking document first published in 1997 that is designed to help both individual SIU members and SIU-contracted companies comply with complex international maritime regulations.</p>
<p class="has-nv-dark-bg-color has-text-color">From July 2011 to August 2022, he served on the U.S. Transportation Department’s Marine Transportation System National Advisory Council. In 2017, he was appointed to serve on the federal U.S. Maritime Workforce Working Group Subcommittee, which is part of the council. The subcommittee is tasked with examining and assessing the size of the pool of United States citizen mariners necessary to support the U.S.-flag fleet in times of national emergency.</p>
<p class="has-nv-dark-bg-color has-text-color">For more than two decades, Tellez has participated in the U.S. Transportation Command’s Voluntary Intermodal Sealift Agreement Executive Working Group (EWG), which is a partnership between the U.S. Government and the U.S. commercial maritime industry. The purpose of the EWG is to strengthen the strategic relationship between the DOD, DOT and the industry with “assured access” to commercial sealift and intermodal capacity to support the emergency deployment and sustainment of U.S. military forces.</p>
<p class="has-nv-dark-bg-color has-text-color">Tellez worked his way up through the ranks, starting with the SIU in 1975 after graduating from the entry program at the Paul Hall Center’s Lundeberg School of Seamanship. He sailed from the union’s Brooklyn, N.Y., hiring hall as an able bodied seaman before coming ashore.</p>
<p class="has-nv-dark-bg-color has-text-color">He served the union in various capacities in Jacksonville, Fla.; Mobile, Ala.; Tampa; Paducah, Ky.; Baltimore; St. Louis; and Houston. In 1980, he became the port agent for the SIU’s headquarters port, located in Brooklyn.</p>
<p class="has-nv-dark-bg-color has-text-color">Tellez in 1987 relocated to what had become the union’s new headquarters in Camp Springs, Md., where he served as special assistant to the president. That same year, he was elected as the vice president for the Seafarers International Union of North America – the parent union of the SIU’s seagoing component. A year later, he became the assistant vice president for contracts and contracts enforcement.</p>
<p class="has-nv-dark-bg-color has-text-color">Tellez met his wife, Susan Lagana, in 1971 in Brooklyn and they were married in 1980. They have three children: Kristen Tellez-Wilson (husband Christian), Lauren Tellez (husband Curtis Reeves), and Augustin Francis Tellez. They have five grandchildren: Gabriel, Kaelynn, River, Noah and Jace.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[A native son of New Jersey, Bill Pascrell, Jr. has built a life of public service around the principles he learned while growing up on the south side of Paterson. Bill credits his parents and his Italian-immigrant grandparents with instilling in him the value of being a bridge builder: one who seeks to bring together the diverse peoples and neighborhoods in our communities to forge a better society.

Bill was first elected Congressman for New Jersey’s 8th Congressional District in 1996. After congressional reapportionment, the district was reconfigured and renumbered to be the 9th Congressional District beginning with the 113th Congress in 2013. Bill is now in his twelfth term.

Since 2007, Bill has served on the powerful, tax-writing House Ways and Means Committee, overseeing numerous economic issues including Social Security, taxes, Medicare, health policy, and international trade. On the committee, Bill has been a champion for the middle class by supporting policies that help facilitate job creation, distribute the tax burden equitably, craft trade agreements that benefit our workers, and make quality health care affordable for all Americans.

Bill is a leader in Congress demanding tax fairness. Heis the lead sponsor of legislation to restore the full state and local tax deduction which was capped by the Republican tax scam law of 2017, stealing a critical economic lifeline for generations of New Jerseyans. Bill is also the prime sponsor on a bill that would finally eliminate the egregious carried interest tax loophole and is leading efforts on the Bring Jobs Home Act to support domestic job creation.

And as Ranking Member of the Subcommittee on Trade in the 115th Congress, Bill was a stalwart voice for workers, constantly demanding national trade policies that put our laborers first. As a senior member of the panel, Bill maintains that drive.

Bill has made environmental protection a top priority. Pascrell is the long-time sponsor of legislation that would foster development of offshore wind energy. He has voted to support the Paris Climate Accord and is also proud cosponsor of the landmark Green New Deal which would establish a framework for the United States to more effectively stop the effects of climate change. Bill enthusiastically led the designation of Paterson’s Great Falls as a crown jewel unit of our National Park System, shepherding into law the Great Falls Historic District Study Act. Bill worked hand-in-hand with President Barack Obama to see that the Great Falls and its 30-acre surrounding area were recognized as the Paterson Great Falls National Historical Park.

In health care, Bill has always supported the Affordable Care Act and has been tireless in protecting it against Republican efforts to revoke health care for millions of Americans and believes we must preserve and strengthen the law. And as the opioid crisis has ravaged our nation, Bill’s Alternatives to Opioids in the Emergency Department Act was signed into law in 2018 to bring nationwide a successful preventative program to fight the epidemic.

As the co-chairman and founder of the Congressional Brain Injury Task Force, Bill has raised the nation’s awareness of the dangers of traumatic brain injury (TBI). TBI was identified as the “signature injury” among soldiers serving in Iraq and Afghanistan, and Bill has worked to make sure that our soldiers are properly screened and diagnosed for concussions. Bill has also worked assiduously to shed greater light on efforts the dangers of TBI to young student athletes. He most recently authored the Traumatic Brain Injury Reauthorization Act and also wrote the Concussion Treatment and Care Tools Act (the ConTACT Act) to advance federal protocols for youth sports which was signed into law in 2010.

Bill is a nationally recognized leader on the issue of fire safety, having proudly authored the Firefighter Investment and Response Enhancement (FIRE) Act of 2000 which established the only federal program that delivers grant dollars directly to fire departments across America. Because of Bill’s work, the nation’s 32,000 career, volunteer, and combination fire departments have applied for hundreds of millions in federal grants to purchase the equipment, training, and vehicles needed to serve their communities. The AFG program also funds Fire Prevention and Safety Grants for fire awareness and prevention activities, as well as fire safety-related research. Bill also crafted the Staffing for Adequate Fire and Emergency Response, or SAFER, grant program signed into law in 2003 which provides additional federal support for local fire departments.

As an ardent fighter on behalf of our military heroes, Bill secured a new Passaic County VA Outpatient Clinic at St. Joseph’s Hospital in Paterson. The community-based facility is the first of its kind in the Ninth District and serves the more than 30,000 veterans in our communities. The Congressman lobbied hard for the clinic, arguing that too often, VA hospitals and clinics such as those in Hackensack and East Orange, are overcrowded and unable to handle the volume of veterans in our communities needing care.

Bill is the longtime co-chair of the Congressional Law Enforcement Caucus where he uses his post to watch out for the interests of community police departments across America. He has led efforts in Congress to protect numerous law enforcement funding streams from sabotage by the Trump administration and was the principal sponsor of H.R. 2379, a congressional reauthorization of the Bulletproof Vest Partnership Grant Program, H.R. 1866, the Probation Officer Protection Act, and H.R. 1865, which would authorize the minting of a coin in honor of the National Law Enforcement Museum.

Bill also serves as co-chair of the Italian-American Congressional Delegation. In addition to serving as a legislative branch liaison to the Republic of Italy, Bill’s role ensures there is a strong voice to promote Italian-American history and culture in Congress.

In previous Congresses, Bill served as a member of the House Committees on Transportation and Infrastructure (1997-2007), Homeland Security (2001-2011), Budget (2011-2017) and Small Business (1997-2001).

As a child, Bill attended St. George’s Elementary School in Paterson and graduated from St. John the Baptist High School. After earning two degrees from Fordham University (B.A. in Journalism, M.A. in Philosophy) in the Bronx, Bill worked as both a high school history teacher and an adjunct professor. Bill also served as president of the Paterson Board of Education and as a member of Passaic County Community College’s Board of Trustees.

Bill served his country in the U.S. Army and the U.S. Army Reserve and received an honorable discharge in 1967.

Bill joined the New Jersey General Assembly in 1988 in his first elected office, rising to become Minority Leader Pro Tempore. While serving in Trenton, Bill was elected mayor of Paterson, New Jersey’s third largest city, in 1990.

Through the years, Bill has been widely recognized for his service and leadership by organizations including the New Jersey Chamber of Commerce, Department of New Jersey Jewish War Veterans, the New Jersey Veterans of Foreign Wars, the New Jersey State Policemen’s Benevolent Association, the New Jersey State Fireman’s Mutual Benevolent Association, Major County Sheriff’s Association, the Brain Injury Association of America, and Ceasefire New Jersey, and the Disabled American Veterans Charity. In Congress, Bill is a member of the prestigious Democratic Steering and Policy Committee that guides his party’s caucus.

Bill and his wife, the former Elsie Marie Botto, have three children and five grandchildren.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Anthony’s family came to America from Italy in 1955, with his parents and six siblings. Anthony married his wife Mary, a now retired Occupational Therapist, in 1971. They have resided on Long Island since 1973 and they have two children, Christina, and Anthony, and three grandchildren, Samantha, Grace, and Anthony Ray. Mary and Anthony passionately believe that it is important to give back to the community and they have both been very involved in numerous charities and have personally raised hundreds of thousands of dollars for worthy causes.

Anthony has been a long-time member of the Sons and Daughters of Italy in America. After Forty-four years in the organization, and moving through the chairs, on June 1, 2019, he became NYS State President of the NYS Grand Lodge, the largest Grand Lodge in the nation with sixty Lodges. He served two years during the pandemic and maintained financial stability through budget cuts and innovative fundraising efforts. He successfully applied modern technology, such as Zoom, Telephone Conferencing, Constant Contact, a Podcast called “Italia Mia”, and a successful Facebook Live Show. He also personally produced twelve videos to maintain personal contact with the members. In 2020, Anthony envisioned a commemorative journal which came to fruition, with the help of a wonderful committee, as a Journal called “Questi Siamo Noi”- “This is Us”. The journal was a huge social and financial success. It was also distributed to every Grand Lodge nationwide. In December 2018, Anthony was Invested as a Cavaliere (Knight), into the “The Order of Merit of Savoy”, the former Royal Family of Italy. In 2022, the Grand Lodge of New York conferred Anthony the “Bene Emeritus Award” the highest honor awarded by the NYS Grand Lodge.

Anthony began in the maritime industry in 1965. While married with two children, working full time, and traveling extensively, he received a Summa Cum Laude degree in accounting from Nassau Community College and continued with the same distinction at Long Island University for business administration. In April 1970 he began a long career with Ogden Marine Inc. who later became OMI Inc. They operated a large fleet of American and foreign flag vessels. He began in accounting and eventually became Vice-President of Labor Relations in 1987, and Vice-President of Human Resources and Administration in 1993. The company grew rapidly, purchasing and building tankers, car carriers, and liquified propane gas vessels.

In 1997 OMI purchased Marine Transport Lines and separated into two companies – foreign flag and the American flag. Anthony remained with the American company, as Vice President of Labor Relations. In 2001, Crowley Maritime purchased MTL, and he was asked to remain. He semi-retired from Crowley from his everyday duties in 2010 but remains active with the company. Anthony will reach fifty-three years of service in April 2023, going back to Ogden Marine in April 1970. His total service to the maritime industry will reach 58 years in June 2023.

For fifteen years, he has been employer Chairman of the Seafarers International Union and the American Maritime Officers Pension and Welfare Funds and of two state-of-the-art training facilities. He has served on the SIU Trustee Board since 1978 and the AMO Board since 1984. The Boards manage over six billion dollars in assets. Anthony is President and Chairman of the American Maritime Officers Service, a Washington based association comprised of some of the largest American flag companies, that promotes the American flag maritime industry. He is also consultant to the American Maritime Association, a consortium of American flag shipping companies, and has served as Chairman of its Tanker Negotiating Committee for over twenty years. He is Chairman of the Executive Committee of the United Seamen’s Service, a non-profit, federally chartered organization founded by the United States Congress in 1942. The organization promotes the welfare of seafarers and the US military personnel overseas. USS has centers in Asia, Africa, and Europe.

Anthony has received numerous maritime awards, along with many community honors. He has received the “Man of the Year Award” from the Maritime Port Council of Greater New York and New Jersey, and the Lifetime Achievement Award from American Safety, an organization that promotes maritime health and safety. He has also received the “Outstanding Friend of Seafarers Award” from the Seafarers International House. This past March he received the 253rd “Lifetime Achievement Award” from The Marine Society of the City of New York. Anthony is exceptionally proud that in 2021 he received the Admiral of The Ocean Sea Award and the Columbus Statue. – the most prestigious honor awarded in the international maritime industry.]]></content:encoded>
